### 修正項目

| 動物 | 來源 | 原問題 | 修正內容 |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| 狼蛛 | C | `releasing a burst of urticating bristles` AI 難渲染噴射微粒 | 改為 `bristles raised and spreading outward`，以靜態豎起取代噴射 |
| 水豚 | A | `wading chest-deep` 水位太淺，不符「潛水隱伏」設計 | 改為 `sinking low into water with only the very top of its head visible above waterline` |
| 紅毛猩猩 | A | `sitting upright holding` 動態感不足 | 改為 `leaning forward and carefully probing with a stick tool`，增加前傾動作 |
| 啄羊鸚鵡 | B | 上喙比例是 Kea 最大辨識特徵但未強調 | 加入 `elongated narrow upper mandible extending well beyond the lower jaw` |
| 負鼠 | B | 臉身毛色對比描述模糊＋尖耳遺漏 | 改為 `dense dark body fur contrasting with distinctly pale face and dark eye patches` + 加入 `large thin pointed bare ears` |
| 象海豹 | C | `rearing upright` 垂直構圖風險 | 改為 `raised at an angle with lower body sprawled wide on ground` |
| 小貓熊 | C | `paws raised high above head` 垂直構圖風險 | 改為 `paws raised wide to the sides` + `tail extending outward for balance` |
| 安地斯神鷲 | C | 正面展翅與丹頂鶴撞姿＋禿頭與兀鷲撞詞 | 改為 `three-quarter angle` + 加入 `fleshy comb-like caruncle on top` 取代通用禿頭描述 |
| 郊狼 | A | `trotting forward` 動態感弱於「獵」字含義 | 改為 `loping forward swiftly` + `dynamic lone hunting stride` |
